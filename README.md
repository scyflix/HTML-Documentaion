# HTML Documentation Project

This repository contains a **structured HTML documentation project** focused on explaining HTML from first principles: how documents are structured, how elements relate to each other, and why certain patterns exist.

The goal is **clarity and correctness**, not flashy tutorials or copy-paste snippets.

---

## What this project is

- A **foundational HTML reference**, written in a logical, topic-based structure  
- Focused on:
  - Document structure
  - Nesting and hierarchy
  - Semantics and meaning
  - Headings and outlines
  - Core content elements
  - Code quality and best practices
- Designed to **teach how HTML works**, not just how to “get something on screen”

This project emphasizes **mental models over memorization**.

---

## What this project is NOT

- ❌ Not a full replacement for freeCodeCamp, MDN, or W3Schools  
- ❌ Not a beginner-only step-by-step course  
- ❌ Not complete in depth for every topic (yet)

Some sections are **introductory stubs** that define concepts clearly but will be expanded later.

---

## Current state (honest status)

- ✅ Topic coverage is **broad and well-structured**
- ✅ Navigation and hierarchy are intentional and scalable
- 🟡 Some sections are **short by design** (definitions & overviews)
- 🟡 Some sections still need:
  - More explanation
  - More examples
  - Clearer “why this matters” context

**Structurally comprehensive, content-wise still evolving.**

---

## Why this exists

Many HTML resources either:
- Oversimplify (“just use this tag”), or
- Overwhelm learners with disconnected details

This project aims to sit in between by explaining:
- **Why HTML is written the way it is**
- **How structure affects meaning, accessibility, and maintainability**

---

## Project structure

- Semantic navigation with expandable sections
- Topic grouping based on **conceptual relationships**
- Examples written using escaped HTML (`&lt;`, `&gt;`)
- Attributes highlighted consistently for readability

---

## Who this is for

- Learners who know basic HTML tags and want deeper understanding
- Developers who want a **clean mental model** of HTML
- Anyone tired of HTML “cheatsheets” with no explanation

---

## Future plans

- Expand shorter sections with deeper explanations
- Add more examples and edge cases
